# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio

> "Transforming innovative ideas into intelligent digital experiences"

I'm a passionate third-year Software Engineering student who loves turning coffee ☕ into code. This portfolio is my digital playground where I showcase my journey in tech, from crafting beautiful UIs to building AI-powered applications.

## 💫 What Makes This Portfolio Special?

This isn't just another portfolio website – it's a reflection of my coding philosophy: clean, modern, and a bit playful! Here's what makes it unique:

- 🎨 **Aesthetic & Interactive**: Clean design with smooth animations that make browsing a joy
- 🌓 **Dark/Light Vibes**: Because good code looks good in any light!
- ⚡ **Lightning Fast**: Built with Vite because waiting is so last century
- 🎯 **Type Safe**: TypeScript all the way, because I like my code like I like my coffee - strong and reliable
- 📱 **Responsive AF**: Looks awesome on everything from your phone to your ultrawide monitor

## 🛠️ Tech Stack - My Digital Tool Belt

I believe in using the right tool for the job. Here's what powers this portfolio:

```typescript
const techStack = {
  framework: "React 19 ⚛️",
  language: "TypeScript 💪",
  buildTool: "Vite 🏃‍♂️",
  routing: "React Router v7 🛣️",
  styling: "CSS Modules 🎨",
  icons: "Lucide React ✨",
  animations: "Custom CSS Magic ✨",
  extras: {
    marquee: "react-fast-marquee 🔄",
    imports: "vite-tsconfig-paths 📁",
  },
};
```
